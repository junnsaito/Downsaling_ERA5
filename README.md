# Downsaling_ERA5
This code provides a method for downscaling native ERA5 data using high-resolution grids. It enables the generation of model outputs required for firn modeling, such as the Community Firn Model (CFM), by computing each necessary component with improved spatial resolution.
You can change the period you are interested in (From main.py) and run the code, python main.py
